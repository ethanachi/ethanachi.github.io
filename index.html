              <p>We present the second iteration of <b>Chirpy Cardinal</b>, an open-domain dialogue agent developed for the Alexa Prize SGC4 competition.
                We focus on improving conversational flexibility, initiative, and coherence, introducing an array of new neural methods and make major improvements
                in entity linking, topical transitions, and latency.
                These components come together to create a refreshed Chirpy Cardinal that is able to
                initiate conversations filled with interesting facts, engaging topics, and heartfelt responses.

              <p>Sequence-to-sequence Transformer speech recognition models achieve extremely high performance,
              but are difficult to deploy in the wild due to long decoding times. Non-autoregressive models
              are significantly faster, but at the cost of degraded performance. We introduced a new non-autoregressive method‚Äî
              Align-Refine‚Äîwhich significantly narrows this gap. Our method achieves SoTA-level performance at a 6x speedup

              <p>Previous work has demonstrated that Transformer encoders learn certain linguistic features,
                like part-of-speech and syntax. In this work, we demonstrate that this is also the case for deeper linguistic
                features like morphosyntactic alignment, a core attribute of all languages. We find that the predictive distributions of subjecthood classifiers
                reflect the morphosyntactic alignment of their training languages, demonstrating the influence of high-level grammatical features not manifested in any one input sentence.

              <p>We show that Multilingual BERT is able to learn a general syntactic structure applicable to a variety of natural languages. Additionally, we find evidence that mBERT learns cross-lingual syntactic categories like ‚Äúsubject‚Äù and ‚Äúadverb‚Äù‚Äîcategories that largely agree with traditional linguistic concepts of syntax! Our results imply that simply by reading a large amount of text, mBERT is able to represent syntax‚Äîsomething fundamental to understanding language‚Äîin a way that seems to apply across many of the languages it comprehends.</p>
